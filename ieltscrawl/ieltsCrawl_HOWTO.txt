Hello EveryOne,


IeltsCrawl is a scrapy program that sends us email everytime for a change in the date value.
It is written in python using scrapy web crawler and MySQL as data storage engine.
Before you run this I assume that you have:

1) MySQL installed in your PC.
2) Scrapy installed in your PC.
3) If not please install them.

Then,

1. Run the mysql commands to create database, table and trigger available in mysqlIelts.sql file in mysqlDesign folder.
2. Go to ieltsCrawl folder.
3. Add your email address in pipelines.py in the folder ieltsCrawl\ieltsCrawl\ in TO list.
4. Save this file and go to outer ieltsCrawl folder and 
4. Run the command "scrapy crawl ieCrawl" (without quotes).
