Hello Everyone,


AmazonCrawl is a scrapy program that fetches all the product details of amazon site product links i.e. you have to provide the link of the product site to be scrapped in a database table called page and just run this program then it will automatically fetch all the details.

Before you begin we assume that you have MySQL and Scrapy installed in your local PC (install it if not)

3. Insert the list of site of amazon's products that you want to fetch.
2. Go to amazonCrawl folder and 
3. Run the command "scrapy crawl amazcrawl" (without quotes)
